Hey 👋, I'm Muhammed Sahal

I'm a Full Stack Developer with a passion for creating clean, functional, and highly responsive
web applications. My journey in tech has been hands-on and project-driven, allowing me to gain
strong technical skills and a deep understanding of the full web development stack. Over the years,
I’ve developed expertise in Python and Django, which I use to build scalable, backend systems. For
the front end, I lean on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, crafting intuitive user interfaces
with a modern feel and interactive elements. I also have experience with RESTful APIs, AJAX, and
advanced animations, which I often integrate into my projects to improve user engagement.

🚀 Current Projects
⌨️ I’m currently developing a comprehensive web app for an interior design company, focused on
showcasing projects and services in an elegant, responsive layout that brings a modern user experience
to life. This project combines my skills in Django and Tailwind CSS to create a platform that’s both
visually appealing and functionally robust.


📚 In parallel, I’m also working on a personal portfolio website featuring animations, Swiper
sliders, and typing effects to give it a unique touch.

💻 I've designed and built projects like a Blogger app with a fully responsive UI and a
Food Delivery web app that allows users to seamlessly browse menus, place orders, and track delivery.

🎨 Technical Interests
I'm always exploring innovative design and animation practices to make user interfaces more engaging.
Right now, I’m deep-diving into advanced Tailwind animations, which I’ve been implementing on various
sections of my projects to add subtle interactions that enhance the user experience. I also enjoy tackling
challenging problems in Django, like efficient data management and creating custom models for complex use cases.
